# tasks5 — spec-kit Task Manager

This directory contains the task manager generated using GitHub's **spec-kit**,
as required in the CSC 299 project instructions.

The original project was created in a separate git repository using spec-kit,
then all files (except the `.git` folder) were copied into this `tasks5`
directory inside `csc299-project`.

## How to run

From inside this `tasks5` directory, follow the commands described in the
generated README or usage instructions (for example):

```bash
python main.py
