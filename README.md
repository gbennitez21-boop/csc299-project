# Selene — A Self-Knowledge System for Women

## Overview

Selene is a terminal-based personal knowledge and task management system designed to help women connect productivity with self-awareness.  
It combines personal notes, task tracking, and menstrual cycle logging to uncover meaningful patterns between focus, mood, and energy levels.
